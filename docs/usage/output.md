# Output files
In this section, the various final and intermediate output files of gapseq are going to be described.

## gapseq find
### *-Pathways.tbl
This file contains detailed information for all pathways that were considered by the ``gapseq find`` command.
It is a tab-separated text file with the following columns: 

| ID         | Name         | Prediction                   | Completeness                   | VagueReactions                                  | KeyReactions                            | KeyReactionsFound             | ReactionsFound           |

| Reaction ID | Reaction name | EC number | Bidirectional hit | Query Seq-id | Percentage of identical matches | Expect value | Bit score | Query Coverage Per Subject | Subject Title | Start of alignment | End of alignment | Associated pathway | Blast status of reaction* | Status of associated pathway** | Mapped model reactions | Detected protein complex | Higher identity cutoff used*** | Status of protein complex |

* *The blast status of a reaction informs about the result of the homology search. It is defined to be: ``bad_blast`` (blast hit with lower quality, i.e. lower bitscore, coverage, or identity than needed for cutoffs), ``good_blast`` (all cutoffs satisfying blast hit), ``no_blast`` (no blast hit found), ``no_seq_data`` (no sequence data available), ``spontaneous`` (no enzyme needed).
* **The status of the associated pathway provides background to the criteria by which a pathway was predicted. The following values are possible: ``full``(All reactions were found), ``keyenzyme`` (Found key reactions indicate pathway presence (at least 66% of the pathway reactions are present)), ``NA`` (The pathway is not predicted to be present), ``threshold`` (Pathway is present because at least 80% of its reactions are present)
* ***For enzymes which have a high similar sequence to other enzymes with different function a higher identity cutoff is used for the blast search (this exceptions are defined in ``gapseq/dat/exceptions.tbl``)
